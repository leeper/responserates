# AAPOR Survey Response Rates #

**responserates** is a package for calculating survey response rates according to the [American Association for Public Opinion Research](http://www.aapor.org/) (AAPOR) [Standard Definitions](http://www.aapor.org/AAPOR_Main/media/publications/Standard-Definitions20169theditionfinal.pdf).

The main function of interest is `rates()`, which calculates all AAPOR standard response, refusal, cooperation, and contact rates based upon specified disposition codes. Disposition codes can be specified either as a vector of character codes (following AAPOR's standard acronyms):


```{r}
library("responserates")
rates(c(rep("I", 100), rep("NC", 20)))
```

or as a table or list of totals (codes are not case-sensitive):

```{r}
rates(list(i = 100, nc = 20))
```

Calculations are performed assuming equal probability of selection, but this can be modified by specifying a vector of codes and corresponding weights:

```{r}
set.seed(1)
rates(c(rep("I", 100), rep("NC", 20)), w = runif(120))
```

If some cases have unknown eligibility, a default value for the proportion eligible (`e` in the Standard Definitions) is assumed to be 1. This can easily be changed if other values are appropriate:

```{r}
rates(list(i = 100, nc = 20, uo = 100, e = .25))
```


The package also exposes functions for calculating each response rate (`rr1()`, `rr2()`, `ref1()`, etc.) based upon counts of disposition codes for a survey.
